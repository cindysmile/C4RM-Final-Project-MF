We aimed to analyze the market risk of Tesla.
As for the market risk, we choose the 90%VaR to represent the risk. Other variables are all factors.
First of all, we downloaded the daily stock price for Tesla and calculated the 90% VaR based on daily returns.
Next, we generated the "market cap", "Enterprise Value", "Trailing P/E", "Forward P/E",
"PEG Ratio", "Price/Sales", "Price/Book", "Enterprise Value/Revenue" and "Enterprise Value/EBITDA".
The data we collected involves 7 months from January to July in 2022.
(the smallest time interval we can find for the data is monthly-based)
